##LINK-https://salarypredicti.herokuapp.com/


Meta Data
Dataset(50*40)-
four colums with experiance ,test score,interview score and the salary.
the data set is a dataset with little outliers and is simple and understandable.

Prediction->
Predicted using the ML based model of linear regression, some eda was also done to find the correlation between different columns.

HOSTING 

used flask ,html,css to build the web application , now i am deploying it using heruko

METHODOLOGY
1)Data Collection->found a salary prediction data on kaggle
2)EDA->Did some data analysis using the matplotlib library and i found the correlation betweem the different columns.
3)Building Models->Tried to find the best model using the eda used before and build a simple linear reggression model.
4)After building the model,deployed the project using flask and communicated with the html and css based front end using the jinja template.
5)css)->tried different colour combinations and then made the beautiful front end using the gradient coluring scheme.
6)finaly hosting the web app that i created in the flask.

CHANGES I WANT TO MAKE
Further changes that i want to create in my applications are;
1)I can use more models and different regression techniques to get more accuracy.
2)creating a better front end
3)saving the details from html form and storing it in mongo db
